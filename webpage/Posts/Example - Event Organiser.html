<h2>Upload onto the internet</h2>
First, save our work to the hard drive; return to the File tab and selecting 'Save to file', call it MyFirstEvent.json. We now want to place the on the internet so that others can assess it with their mobile.

One option is to use a service like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">dropbox</a>. Setup a Dropbox account if you already do not have one, and upload your MyFirstEvent.json file to your Dropbox.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-446" src="http://www.easyeventapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DropBoxEO-300x282.png" alt="" width="300" height="282" />

Select "share, then "copy link". This will give you something like https:///www.dropbox.com/...../MyFirstEvent.json?dl=0. In the link that you give to mobile users you want to replace the "?dl=0" at the end with "?raw=1". This ensures that you link to the actuall file, rather than a message informing about the file.

The dropbox link is a little difficult to rember or type, so you might want to set up a redirect from your website. The file is also downable at http://www.easyeventapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MyFirstEvent.json
